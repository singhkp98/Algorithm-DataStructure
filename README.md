# Algorithm-DataStructure

Algorithm and data structure projects


This repository contains a list of all the data structures and algorithms implemented and studied
during the course "Algorithm and Data Strcuture" provided by Universit√† di Parma. 

All the folders named as "Consegna" contains assignment implemented independently.

The rest of the files contains a low level implementation in C language of all the main data structures and algorithms.

Also "DOT language" has been used in some files in order to create a graphical view of the code using "Graphviz" as 
an open source software. To use this functionality install: https://graphviz.org/
